# Silent Chat â€” Custom Binary Protocol Chat App

A simple 1-to-1 local chat application built in Python using a **custom binary protocol** over TCP sockets.

---

## Features

- Custom binary packet design with start byte, command, length, data, and checksum
- Clean message parsing and building in `utils.py`
- Text chat with usernames
- Graceful connection close with `BYE` command to prevent socket errors
- Works on localhost or LAN
- Designed for learning how low-level machine communication protocols work

---

## How to Run

1. Create and activate your Python virtual environment  
2. Run `server.py` in one terminal and enter a username  
3. Run `client.py` in another terminal and enter a username  
4. Chat by typing messages, and type `bye` to end the chat gracefully

- Add support for sending **files** and **custom emojis**  
- Embed **timestamps** and **message IDs** inside protocol packets  
- Build a **simple GUI** to improve chat experience
